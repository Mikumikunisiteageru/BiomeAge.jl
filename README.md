# BiomeAge.jl

BiomeAge.jl is the accessory software package of an article published on New Phytologist ([Zhang et al., 2024, 10.1111/nph.19524](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.19524)) analyzing the history of East Asian evergreen broad-leaved forests (EAEBLF). It creates the Figures [2](https://github.com/Mikumikunisiteageru/BiomeAge.jl/blob/master/chebleaf/workflow.jl), [3](https://github.com/Mikumikunisiteageru/BiomeAge.jl/blob/master/chebleaf/galileo.jl), and [4](https://github.com/Mikumikunisiteageru/BiomeAge.jl/blob/master/chebleaf/tlcc.jl) in the article from [divergence time data](https://github.com/Mikumikunisiteageru/BiomeAge.jl/blob/master/chebleaf/lineages.tsv).

## Installation and usage

This package runs on Julia. It requires an unregistered package Entropics.jl, which can be installed by
```julia
]add https://github.com/Mikumikunisiteageru/Entropics.jl
```
Then, this package BiomeAge.jl can be installed likewise by
```julia
]add https://github.com/Mikumikunisiteageru/BiomeAge.jl
```
At this point, the core functions --- those applicable in similar analysis on other biomes --- should be ready.

To redraw the figures specifically designed for the EAEBLF biome, some additional package should be also installed using
```julia
]add DelimitedFiles, GeologicTime, JLD2, Printf, PyPlot
```
Run the scripts except the `savefig` lines at the end, and the figures in the article can be exactly reproduced.
